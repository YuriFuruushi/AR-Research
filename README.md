# AR Research

## Objective

- Learn new AR solution;
- Build an working example;
- Simulate your facial expressions and lip movement;

## Research Step by Step

1. Lookup all three examples
- AR Foundation
- Tensorflow
- Mediapipe
2. Unity Agents
- Barracuda
3. Tutorials
- Google
- Youtube
4. Examples Search
5. Example Refactoring

## Skills Learned

- **Load/Run pre-trained neural networks models in the ONNX format using Unity Barracuda.**

## Conclusion

### AR Foundation

Most features already know, no further study is required.

- Simple interface;
- Exclusive for Mobile;
- ARCore (Android)
- ARKit (iOS);
- Used before in my Robot Controller project: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN8qGs-XbK0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN8qGs-XbK0)

### TensorFlow & Mediapipe

- Based on machine learning models
- Basic Models can be read by Unity using ML-Agents and Barracuda;
- Requires Model format ONNX;
- Can also work with TensorFlowSharp;

```

Time spent in Research and Development: 5 hours
