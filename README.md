# AR Test

## AR RESEARCH

## Objective

- Learn new AR solution;
- Build an working example;
        - Simulate your facial expressions and lip movement;

## Research Step by Step

1. Lookup all three examples
        1. AR Foundation
        2. Tensorflow
        3. Mediapipe
2. Unity Agents
        1. Barracuda
3. Tutorials
        1. Google
        2. Youtube
4. Examples Search
5. Example Refactoring

## Skills Learned

- **Load/Run pre-trained neural networks models in the ONNX format using Unity Barracuda.**

## Conclusion

### AR Foundation

Most features already know, no further study is required.

- Simple interface;
- Exclusive for Mobile;
        - ARCore (Android)
        - ARKit (iOS);
- Used before in my Robot Controller project: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN8qGs-XbK0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN8qGs-XbK0)

### TensorFlow & Mediapipe

- Based on machine learning models
- Basic Models can be read by Unity using ML-Agents and Barracuda;
        - Requires Model format ONNX;
- Can also work with TensorFlowSharp;

```

Time spent in Research and Development: 5 hours
